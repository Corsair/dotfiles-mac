* My Dot Files

My dot files for GNU Emacs and Zsh, mainly.

** The Emacs dot files

*** Installation

    1. Copy =.emacs.el= and the =.emacs-pkgs= directory to your home
       directory.
    2. Edit =~/.emacs-pkgs/mw-user-example.el= by uncommenting the
       last line. Rename the file to =~/.emacs-pkgs/mw-user.el=.
    3. Start Emacs. The 1st start is going to take some time, as Emacs
       is going to download some packages. It will also prompt you to
       install some other packages.
    4. You may want to change some of the settings by editing the
       =mw-user.el= file.

*** Usage

    This configuration is designed so that you donâ€™t have to install a
    lot of packages to make it work. But if you have a package that it
    is configured for, the configuration would take effect, thanks to
    [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]].

    The bulk of the configuration is in the =.emacs-pkgs= directory.
    After the installation, this directory should be at
    =$HOME/.emacs-pkgs=. This can be changed by editing the 1st line
    of =.emacs.el= file.

    The =*Simple Splash*= buffer shows some of the modified key
    bindings.
