* Corsairâ€™s Dot-files for Mac

These are my dot-files for various programs in Mac OS X, including the
configuration for

- The super awesome Emacs
- The suck-less Mutt & Msmtp
- The awesome Zsh
- The awesome Tmux
- The awesome Pentadactyl (a little bit)
- The super awesome Git (a tiny bit)

Also included are some scripts I use:

- =Change-uid.sh= to properly change UID in Mac OS X
- =Context-minimal-exec.sh= to run a command temporarily under my
  installation of [[http://wiki.contextgarden.net/ConTeXt_Standalone][ConTeXt Standalone]].
- =Rand-sig.py= to randomly choose signatures when sending emails.
- =Try.sh= to repeat a command until success.
- =Appify.py= to convert any executable into an application bundle.

And finally some other scripts I use but are not included (because they
are hosted in some other places, etc.)

- [[https://github.com/Corsair/Retrmail][Retrmail]], my POP3 client.
- [[https://gist.github.com/1401473][Generate Zalgo-ified text.]]
