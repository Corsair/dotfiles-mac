* My Dot Files

My dot files for GNU Emacs and Zsh, mainly.

** Installation

    Run =install.py= and follow the instructions. Run =install.py -h=
    for more options.

** The Emacs dot files

   This configuration is designed so that you donâ€™t have to install a
   lot of packages to make it work. But if you have a package that it
   is configured for, the configuration would take effect, thanks to
   [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]].

   The bulk of the configuration is in the =.emacs-pkgs= directory.
   After the installation, this directory should be at
   =$HOME/.emacs-pkgs=. This can be changed by editing the 1st line of
   =.emacs.el= file.

   The =*Simple Splash*= buffer shows some of the modified key
   bindings.
