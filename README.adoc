All the cool projects have a build status badge, even if they don’t
really need it.

== Installation

Run `install.py -s mac` and follow the instructions. Run `install.py
-h` for more options.

== The Emacs dot files

This configuration is designed so that you don’t have to install a lot
of packages to make it work. But if you have a package that it is
configured for, the configuration would take effect, thanks to
https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package[use-package].

The bulk of the configuration is in the `.emacs-pkgs` directory. After
the installation, this directory should be at `$HOME/.emacs-pkgs`.
This can be changed by editing the 1st line of `.emacs.el` file.

The `*Simple Splash*` buffer shows some of the modified key bindings.
